  Transaction is an event that is recorded and cannot be modified afterwards.
  It is possible to build a transaction in multiple steps, but once it is committed it should not be used any longer.

  Note: Even if the transaction is a actual unique atomic "event", for optimisation on local read models,
  the transaction is split into various entries, stored in multiple accounts in the ledger.
  This is an optimisation as we are mostly interested in the "balance of an account", and we want to optimise for this case.
  As accounting is local to a process, we don't lose anything in doing so, except performance if transaction browsing ever becomes the main usage..
