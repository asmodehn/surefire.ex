# We need a game/player model that "implicitly" reduce...
# - get inspirations from CRDTs ??
# - design an "inner module" only for reduceable player actions ?
# - other solution ??
# CAREFUL : the way these reduce ARE part of the game rules
#
# => make game a collectable ??
# Note : if we keep track of all actions, we can make it an enumerable as well ?? -> allows replays
